# 42 Security
This repository is a pointer to the projects from the Security branch of school 42 that I have completed. (from the most recent to the oldest)

- [Snow Crash](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Snow-Crash)
"Snow Crash will make you discover security in various sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. You will become familiar with several languages (ASM/perl/phpâ€¦), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and become aware of problems linked to simple programming errors"

- [Cybersecurity Piscine](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Cybersecurity-Piscine)
"This project aims to introduce you to cybersecurity in various sub-domains."
